# hello-world
testing use of github repositories for future use in programming

Hello there stranger. My name is MrKimhof and I'm just getting into computer programming. I have taken some classes in C and Java though those were several years ago. I just got out of the USAF recently and am currently pursuing getting a degree in software development. I am working my way through edx's cs50 course to understand the basics of computer science again. I'm super excited on this path i'm about to take and could use all the help and support from this community as i can get. HELLO WORLD!
